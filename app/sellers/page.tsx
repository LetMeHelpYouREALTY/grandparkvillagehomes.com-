                  q: "How long will it take to sell my Las Vegas home?",
                  a: "In September 2026, 53.4% of Las Vegas homes sold within 30 days (Las Vegas REALTORS). $1M+ homes took a median of 38 days over the past year. The key is pricing correctly from day one—overpriced homes can sit for months, losing both time and money.",

                {
                  q: "What do I need to do to prepare my home for sale?",
                  a: "Dr. Jan provides a personalized preparation checklist for every listing. Generally, decluttering, minor repairs, fresh paint, and professional staging consultation yield the highest ROI. She'll walk through your home and identify exactly what improvements will generate the best return.",

                  q: "How will Dr. Jan market my home?",
                  a: "Your home gets professional photography, virtual tours, drone video (when appropriate), MLS syndication to 100+ websites, social media promotion, and targeted digital advertising. It's the most comprehensive marketing available in Las Vegas real estate.",
                },
                {
                  q: "What are your commission rates?",
                  a: "Commission structures are negotiable and competitive with other full-service brokerages. Dr. Jan offers transparent pricing and will walk you through all costs during your listing consultation. The value of strong marketing and negotiation typically results in higher sale prices that more than offset commission.",
                },
                {
                  q: "Should I wait for prices to go higher?",
                  a: "Prices are flat: the September 2026 single-family median was $470,000, the same as a year earlier and below the $490,000 spring record. Timing the market is difficult—most sellers do better by listing when ready rather than waiting. Dr. Jan can provide a personalized market analysis to help you decide.",

                  q: "Do I need to be moved out before listing?",
                  a: "Not necessarily. Many homes sell while occupied. However, vacant homes are easier to show and stage. Dr. Jan will help you develop a strategy based on your specific situation and timeline.",
